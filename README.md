# Run Modes

This package provides a skeleton for machine learning experiments. The aim is to take care of some of the boiler plate code written in many machine learning experiment pipelines (configurations, runners, etc.).

# Getting Started

Installation can either be performed by cloning the repository and running ```pip install -e .``` from the package root, or via ```pip install -e git://github.com/seblee97/run_modes.git#egg=run-modes-seblee97```.
